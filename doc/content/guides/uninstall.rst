Uninstalling
============

To uninstall eclim you can use any eclim distribution jar whose version is
1.7.5 or greater by running it with the 'uninstaller' argument like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ java -jar eclim_eclim_release.jar uninstaller

That will open a graphical wizard much like the install wizard which will ask
you again for the location of your vimfiles and eclipse home where you've
installed eclim and will then remove the eclim installation accordingly.

.. note::

  The uninstaller is backwards compatible and can be used to uninstall older
  versions of eclim.

.. _uninstall-automated:

Unattended (automated) uninstall
--------------------------------

Like the installer, the uninstaller also supports an unattended uninstall. You
just need to supply your vim files and eclipse paths as system properties:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ java \
    -Dvim.files=$HOME/.vim \
    -Declipse.home=/opt/eclipse \
    -jar eclim_eclim_release.jar uninstall

**Required Properties:**

* **eclipse.home** - The absolute path to your eclipse installation.
* **vim.files** (or **vim.skip=true**) - The absolute path to your vim files
  directory. Or if you never installed the vim files (emacs-eclim users for
  example) you can supply `-Dvim.skip=true` instead.
