==================
What is it?
==================

Eclim provides the ability to access Eclipse_ features (code completion,
searching, code validation, and :doc:`many more </features>`) via the command
line or a local network connection, allowing those features to be integrated
with your favorite editor. Eclim provides an integration with Vim_, but
:doc:`third party clients </relatedprojects>` have been created to add eclim
support to other editors as well (emacs, sublime text 2, textmate).

There are three primary usage scenarios in which eclim is designed to be used:

.. image:: images/diagrams/use_cases.png

#. The :ref:`first scenario <eclimd-headless>` is for those for which vim is
   their primary editing interface.  In this scenario you run a headless
   instance of eclipse which all vim instances can then communicate with to
   provide the various eclipse features.

#. The :ref:`second scenario <eclimd-headed>` is for those who prefer using vim
   as their main interface, but frequently end up jumping back to eclipse for
   any features not provided by eclim.  In this case you can run the eclim
   server inside of the eclipse gui and then interact with it via external vim
   instances just like the first scenario.

#. The :ref:`last scenario <gvim-embedded>` is for those who wish to use the
   eclipse interface full time, but want to use gvim as an embedded eclipse
   editor. Just like the previous use case, the eclim server is run inside of
   the eclipse gui and the embedded gvim will interact with it just like
   external vim instances would. This feature is only support on Windows and
   Unix systems (where gvim is compiled with the gtk gui).

   .. note::

     Please be aware that the embedded vim does not behave like a standard
     eclipse editor. It's a separate program (vim) embedded into eclipse, so
     eclipse features are provided by eclim's vim plugins and not the usual
     eclipse key bindings, context menus, etc. For those that just want vim like
     key bindings in their eclipse editors, vrapper_ is an excellent alternative
     which provides exactly that.

Eclim is released under the GPLv3_.

========================
How do I get/install it?
========================

You can follow the :doc:`eclim install guide </install>` which will walk you
through downloading and installing eclim.

================
How do I use it?
================

After you've installed eclim, you can refer to the :doc:`getting started
</gettingstarted>` page which will walk you through creating your first
project.

Jul. 14, 2013
-------------

This is primarily a bug fix release with a few new features. Unless some
critical error is found, this will be the last release targeting Juno. The next
release will likely target Kepler though this release should work fine on Kepler
as well, with the exception of scala support which has not been tested. Indigo
support will continue but will likely end with the release of Luna, possibly
sooner.

- :ref:`Eclim 2.2.7 <2.2.7>` for Eclipse 4.2 (Juno).
- :ref:`Eclim 1.7.16 <1.7.16>` for Eclipse 3.7/3.8 (Indigo).

May 18, 2013
-------------

Eclim has been updated to support the Android Development Toolkit version

development toolkit (21.0.0).

Please note that the `Scala IDE <http://scala-ide.org>`_ , which eclim uses to
provide scala support, is not yet available for Eclipse 4.2 (Juno), so eclim's
scala support will not be available for the eclim 2.2.x releases until sometime
after the Scala IDE has been updated for Juno.

- :ref:`Eclim 1.7.8 <1.7.8>` for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo).

Eclim also has a newly redesigned site using the
`sphinx bootstrap theme <https://github.com/ervandew/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`_.

.. warning::

   Non vim users (emacs-eclim, subclim, etc.): The underlying command response
   format for eclim has changed, which means that any project relying on the
   old format isn't going to work. So if you are installing eclim for use with
   a client other than vim, then be sure to check with the client project to
   see if it has been updated for eclim 1.7.3 or later.
