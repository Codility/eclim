Java Debugging
================

.. _\:JavaDebugStart:

Start debug session
-------------------
A debug session can be started by using **:JavaDebugStart** command.
This command requires a hostname/IP and the port number on which the debug server is running.

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugStart localhost 5000

.. _\:JavaDebugToggleBreakpoint:

Add/remove a single breakpoint
------------------------------
To add a breakpoint, simply open the file, position the cursor on the desired line and run **:JavaDebugToggleBreakpoint** command.
To remove the breakpoint, run the same command again.

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugToggleBreakpoint

.. _\:JavaDebugBreakpoint:

Retrieve/Delete all breakpoints
-------------------------------
To get all existing breakpoints or delete all existing breakpoints, run **:JavaBreakpoint** command with an action.

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugBreakpoint get_all
  :JavaDebugBreakpoint delete_all

.. _\:JavaDebugStep:

Step
----
There are 3 ways to step through code using **:JavaDebugStep** command and an action argument.
#. over: Step over current line
#. into: Step into a function
#. return: Return from current function

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugStep into
  :JavaDebugStep over
  :JavaDebugStep return

.. _\:JavaDebugVars:

Variables
---------
When a breakpoint is hit, or a thread is suspended, you can retrieve the variables available in the current stack frame
using **:JavaDebugVars** command. It will open a temporary window and display the variables in it.
Right now, it only shows values for primitive variables. Support for viewing objects and the their fields will be added soon.

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugVars

.. _\:JavaDebugVars:

Stack Frames
------------
To view the current stack frames, run **:JavaDebugStackFrame** command. It will open a temporary window and display the stack frames
of all threads.

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugStackFrame

.. _\:JavaDebugControl:

Control
-------
To suspend, resume or stop the debug session, you can use **:JavaDebugControl** command.
             
.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaDebugControl suspend
  :JavaDebugControl resume
  :JavaDebugControl stop
